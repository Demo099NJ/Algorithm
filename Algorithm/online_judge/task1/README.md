# two different ideas of the first test:
# first:
# sort the whole elements -> select the median of the array -> print k elements before median and k elements behind median
# second:
# use a quick way to find the median -> set priority queues and put the elements that bigger than median into one queue, the elements smaller than median into another queue; after one traverse, we will get the result

# about the second test: find two adjacent numbers first if exist, then widen the spacing of the numbers
